## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out a blog preview card and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Users should be able to see hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### Liberties taken

For this challenge, I added two sections to the solution:

-   A section with the feature / latest blog post
-   A second sections with past blog posts using a grid to display 3 cards on a desktop and stack them on mobile.

Obviously, with this additional section it is not going to match the Frontend Mentor design.
